# Cyclistic Case Study

## Intro:
This case study was completed by Jesse Richardville in December 2022 as part of the Capstone unit of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. R and Power BI have been used to complete this case study, which has been posted online through GitHub.

## Brief:

As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, IL, the director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. My team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## About the Company:

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, the director of marketing believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

The director of marketing has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The director of marketing and her team are
interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Phases of Data Analysis:

### Ask
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members based on three questions:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members

### Prepare
Obtain and import data for cleaning, formatting, and transformation:
1. Data is complete, original, and open source, directly from the company (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license (https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). I have chosen to analyze 12 months of data from 12/2021 - 11/2022, which was last updated on Dec 8th 2021, 02:19:04 pm.
2. Download data and store it appropriately.

3. Merge, sort, filter, format, and transform the data using R for analysis and document this process.

### Process
Document the cleaning and manipulation of data:
1. R-Studio Desktop was used for data cleaning and transformation.
2. .Rmd files are included for the processing steps.

### Analyze
Organize data for analysis and to create visuals:
1. Run statistical analysis and add formatted columns to dataset for new variables to use for visualizations.
2. Import data to Power BI to identify trends and relationships, and to use for visualizations.

### Share
Create visuals and a presentation (consider original questions and audience/stakeholders):
1. Use Power BI for visuals (since it is often referenced in job descriptions).
2. Publish Power BI dashboard for presentation.

4. Create presentation using Powerpoint (for Power BI embed).

### Act
Present findings and give top three recommendations:
1. Determine how to apply insights
2. Determine next steps based on findings (consider pros and cons and if more data is needed)
3. Add case study to portfolio
